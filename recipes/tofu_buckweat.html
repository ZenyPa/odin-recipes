    <p>Tofu Buckwheat is a great 15minute recipe when you're tired and just want to eat. It takes just two ingredients and you can add some fresh veggies or avocado if you have it in the fridge.
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Smoked or other type tofu block.</li>
        <li>Buckwheat.</li>
        <li>Fresh veggies.</li>
        <li>Avocado.</li>
        <li>Spices.</li>
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Eyball some buckwheat in a pot and pour hot water over it so it covers it with 2cm of water.</li>
            <li>Put it on medium heat for 12m and check the moisture level. The water needs to essentially fully evaporate, but the buckwheat needs to not burn and stick to the pot.</li>
            <li>Now pout some virign olive oil into a pan and throw the tofu block cut into whatever pieces you like. I cut it into small chunks.</li>
            <li>Let the tofu fry and as both sides brown, add your favourite spices: pepper, salt, oregano, spice mixes, herbs.</li>
            <li><b>Bonus flavour tip: Add nutritional yeast as the finisher. Don't mix up the tofu, let it sit on top.</b></li>
        </ol>

    </p>
    <p>And that's it, as soon as the buckwheat is done, you should throw it in a bowl and put the tofu on top.
        <br>
        Enjoy!
    </p>
